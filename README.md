# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview of Project
Bobby was given a chance to assist the Human Resource Dept at Pewlett Hackard. By identifying the potential retirees, it will help PH device a Mentorship program to make the transition process run smoothly for this “silver tsunami” as the Baby Boomers will reach their retirement age. There will be a massive internal promotion that will happened as mentees will be given a chance to be promoted to fill in those managerial position that retirees are currently holding. Also, this project will update the current program that Pewlett Hackard has not been done for so long. Based on the results that will be generated, it will help analyze and redesign the current organizational structure of the company.

1) How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
After filtering the report with the (Distinct On) we found out that there were 90,398 roles that will potentially be vacant and are in urgent need to be filled out as soon as the workforce starts retiring at any given time.
2) Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
No, we only have  1,940 employees who are eligible to participate in the mentorship program.
